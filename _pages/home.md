**Software is an important research product.**  
It should be **cited** like all other scientific products.

The following guides help researchers understand present issues and cite
research software correctly in their publications. They also present
authors of research software with tools that can help ensure their
software can be cited in a way that follows best practices.

Researchers and software developers aren't the only stakeholders in
research software citation, and thus the list below will be extended to
include others as well, such as repositories, funders, indexers, etc. If
you're keen to see guides for these parties sooner rather than later,
please consider [contributing them](#contributions).

### Communities working on research software citation solutions

-   The [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working
    Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group)
    -- successor of the [FORCE11 Software Citation Working
    Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group)
    -- works on implementations of software citation workflows.
-   The [WSSSPE community](http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/)
    (*Working Towards Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and
    Experiences*) is working on research software sustainability, and
    software citation is an important part of it.

### Projects

-   The [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
    is a machine- and human-readable and -writable format for software
    citation metadata files.
-   The [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) project provides
    compatibility information across software metadata formats via a
    crosswalk table, and a minimal schema for software metadata,
    complete with an implementation in JSON-LD.
-   The [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) repository accepts research
    products of all kinds -- including software -- and provides DOIs for
    artifacts, making research products sustainable.
-   The [figshare](https://figshare.com/) repository also accepts source
    code and binaries and provides DOIs for them.
-   [CiteAs](https://citeas.org/) retrieves citation information for
    different types of research products, including software.
-   [shouldacite](https://mr-c.github.io/shouldacite/) offers guidance
    on whether a specific software should be cited and provides further
    pointers as to how to cite and get cited.
